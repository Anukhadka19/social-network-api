# Social Network Api App

This app is a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. The applications used to execute this project are Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

## Tests

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
